The main issue with the padding oracle is that it leaks information to the attacker.
Therefore the solution is to prevent the attacker from knowing when a padding error has occurred.

One way this can be solved by including a MAC(message authentication code) that checks
whether or not the message came from the correct sender. If it didn't come from
the right sender then don't bother checking the padding. This could be done
with normal public key signing techniques.

Another thought I had was if you changed the padding scheme to something nondeterministic this might
mitigate the attack because the attack requires that the attacker can guess what the contents of the padding bytes should be.
