# Homework 13 -- Writeup

## 1) Restate the ideas you're working on
### Who does this Benefit?
This benefits someone trying to learn chess and would like to memorize famous games

### What is the media they interact with?
They interact with the recorded games and then test there performance with the quiz by playing the game

### What interaction will they have?
They will interact with the media by playing the game and moving the pieces

### What goal will they achieve?
They will be able to memorize the games

### How do they know they accomplished the goal?
The app will flash a correct/incorrect sign to see if they were able to play the game correctly.

## 2) Based on the feedback you got pick the 3 features that need to be iterated on to allow users to complete the goal

### Feature 1: Game Navigation
#### What is the feature that needs to be iterated?
It was very hard to study the game since you could only go in one direction ( to the next move ) and it was difficult to jump to different points in the game

#### Why is this essential to achieving the goal?
When studying the game the user needs to be able to look at the game's states numerous times. Go backwards and forwards to view the previous moves. They also
might want to jump to a later point in the game so that they can review a piece they may have forgotten without playing through the whole game.

#### Screenshots

#### What did you change?
In the original prototype the only way to move forward was a small button that moved to the next state. In this version I removed that button,
and I added a slider so that the user can see multiple states, and can scroll through them quickly and easily.


### Feature 2: Quiz Feedback
#### What is the feature that needs to be iterated?
When taking the quiz the user needs to know if they got the question right or not.

#### Why is this essential to achieving the goal?
The user needs feedback to know if they are learning the game correctly or not. If they didn't have this feedback they would never know if they made the right move or not.

#### Screenshots

#### What did you change?
In the original only a tiny text box popped up below the board. This feedback was mostly lost on the user and wasn't clear.
I changed it so that it flashes a check mark for correct and an "X" for incorrect. This will make it clear to the user.


### Feature 3: Board Score
#### What is the feature that needs to be iterated?
The score of the board was only a number

#### Why is this essential to achieving the goal?
The score of the board is essential so the user understands which moves are significant and which ones are less so. If the user doesn't learn the significance of the moves,
they won't be able to apply these patterns and ideas when they play their own games.
#### Screenshots

#### What did you change?
In the original the score was just displayed as a tiny number on the bottom of the app. Now the score is displayed as a chart on the side of the board so the user can track the score throughout the game and the slope of the line graph symbolizes the significance of the moves.
