# User Interaction
---

### 1) What is the primary reason users interact with a site?
Users generally interact with a site to accomplish a goal.

### 2) Is browsing the primary design goal of most websites?
Browsing is not the primary goal of most sites. Generally browsing is what's required to get to what you actually want. Usually sites provide solutions for many goals. The site can't immediately provide you with what you want (it cant try). So it has to give you the ability to choose between the options.

### 3) What is the primary goal of this interface?
The primary goal is to book a flight.

### 4) What is the subgoal of this page?
The subgoal of this page is to find the flight going to and from specific destinations.

### What low level interactions would the user do on this page to achieve the subgoal?
The user must type in the arrival and departure cities. Then they have to click search.

### When they execute those actions, what will the user see or do to be able to evaluate whether they achieved that subgoal?
The user will get visual feedback as they type and see the box filled in, an then the page will change in some way when they click search.

### After completing this subgoal what is the next important subgoal the user will be guided to do?
The user will then be guided to picking which of the available flights they want to buy.

### After completing all the subgoals, what is the piece of feedback they will get to evaluate whether their original high level goal was achieved?
At some point there will be a receipt/confirmation made available to them that will confirm they have bought the selected flight.
